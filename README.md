This is our Demo Day project that was supposed to take place by the end of March 2020.

Due to the partial lockdown in Malaysia, the demo day has been postponed indefinitely.

The idea for this website come from wanting to help those struggling with their mental health to be able to write what is on their mind anonymously, and receive encouragement from other users. This app was coded within 2 weeks.
